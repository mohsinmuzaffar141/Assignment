What is BDD?
Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is the software development process that Cucumber was built to support.

BDD is a way for software teams to work that closes the gap between business people and technical people by:

Encouraging collaboration across roles to build shared understanding of the problem to be solved
Working in rapid, small iterations to increase feedback and the flow of value
Producing system documentation that is automatically checked against the systemâ€™s behaviour
